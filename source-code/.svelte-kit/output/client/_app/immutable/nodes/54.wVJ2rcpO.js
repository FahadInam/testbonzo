          have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of
          advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by
          cookies and other technologies as non-\xAD\u2010 personal information.
          However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or
          similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law,
          we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to
          the extent that non-\xAD\u2010personal information is combined with personal
          information, we treat the combined information as personal information
          for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">Knowledge Platform and its partners may use cookies and other
          technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of
          times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests,
          and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to
          receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you
          can opt out by e-\xAD\u2010 mailing us at info@knowledgeplatform.com. If you
          opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads,
          but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your
          interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page
          or in an application or based on other non-\xAD\u2010personal information.
          This opt-\xAD\u2010out applies only to Knowledge Platform advertising services

          advertising networks.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">Knowledge Platform and our partners may also use cookies and other

          and clickstream data.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to
          administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to

          Knowledge Platform may use this information in our marketing and
          advertising services.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">In some of our email messages, we use a \u201Cclick-\xAD\u2010through URL\u201D linked
          to content on the Knowledge Platform website. When customers click one
          of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving
          at the destination page on our website. We track this click-\xAD\u2010through
          data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure
          the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to
          be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in
          the email messages.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can
          read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this
          information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p></div> <div class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-base sm:text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Disclosure to Third Parties</h2> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">At times Knowledge Platform may make certain personal information
          available to strategic partners that work with Knowledge Platform to
          provide products and services, or that help Knowledge Platform market
          to customers. Personal information will only be shared by Knowledge

          enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your
          interest in our products and services, and conducting customer

          requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside
          your country of residence \u2212 for Knowledge Platform to disclose your
          personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we
          determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or
          other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or
          appropriate.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">We may also disclose information about you if we determine that
          disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions
          or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a
          reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal
          information we collect to the relevant third party.</p></div> <div class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-base sm:text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Protection of Personal Information</h2> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">Knowledge Platform takes precautions \u2014 including administrative,

          unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">Knowledge Platform online services use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
          encryption on all web pages where personal information is collected.
          To make purchases from these services, you must use an SSL-\xAD\u2010enabled
          browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Doing so
          protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it\u2019s
          transmitted over the Internet.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">When you use some Knowledge Platform products, services, or
          applications or post on a Knowledge Platform forum, chat room, or
          social networking service, the personal information you share is
          visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.
          You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit
          in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email
          address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take

          we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if
          Knowledge Platform is not required to retain it by law or for
